- **Utility Commands**:
  - Open Notepad, Command Prompt, and Camera
  - Fetch IP Address
  - Send emails
  - Get weather updates
  - News reading
  - IMDb movie information
  - Basic calculations using WolframAlpha API
- **Custom Hotkeys**:
  - Start listening: `Ctrl + Alt + K`
  - Stop listening: `Ctrl + Alt + P`

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pyttsx3`: Text-to-speech conversion
  - `SpeechRecognition`: Recognize speech input
  - `keyboard`: Detect key presses for hotkeys
  - `requests`: HTTP requests
  - `pyautogui`: Automating the mouse and keyboard
  - `wolframalpha`: WolframAlpha API for calculations
  - `imdbpy`: Fetching IMDb movie data
  - `webbrowser`: Opening browser for web-based actions
- **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment and environment consistency

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. **Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **VS Code (Optional)**: If you're using VS Code, install the Docker extension for easy Docker management.

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/voice-assistant
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Running with Docker

1. Install Docker (if not installed already). You can use **Docker Desktop** for Windows and macOS or follow the instructions for Linux.
2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t voice-assistant .
   ```
3. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -it voice-assistant
   ```

### VS Code Docker Extension

If you prefer using VS Code's Docker extension:

1. Install the **Docker Extension** in VS Code.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Build and run the Docker image using the Docker extension UI.
